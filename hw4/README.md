Didn't do the bouns

• get projection matrix() in main.cpp: copt the code from previous homework for projection matrix
• phong fragment shader() in main.cpp: compute the fragment color according
to blinn-phong reflection model by adding Diffuse, Specular and Ambient Shading.
• texture fragment shader() in main.cpp: compute the fragment color according
to blinn-phong reflection model; use the texture color as the kd coefficient
in the formula.
• rasterize triangle(const Triangle& t) in rasterizer.cpp: use z-buffer to set color; interpolate
the needed attributes using barycentric coordinates, and pass them to the fragment shader payload.
